# VISTA

VISTA is a proof of concept for a V2V Security, Identity, and Trust Architecture (VISTA) example security framework implemented in Python.  This proof of concept is not an implied endorsement that the VISTA framework is either sufficient or unique as a V2V security solution, but instead exists as a research and development baseline for community experimentation.  Furthermore, this proof of concept implementation, while substantially functional, is not of production quality.  Features and best-practices must be assumed to remain incomplete and their absence is not an endorsement of their necessitity or otherwise.

Major components include an **authority** responsible for authorizing link participants and managing cryptographic keys together with an associated REST API **server**, a **transceiver** which produces periodic squitters and validates received link messages, and a  **client** CLI tool allowing user interaction with the authority server and management of transceivers.  The **crypto** package implements utility functions and wrappers around the cryptographic libraries, while the **models** package includes data models for the REST API, domain (V2V link), and SQL backend.

## Installation

Vista requires Python 3.7.  Instructions for installing the Stanford PBC and Charm-crypto libraries are available [here](https://github.com/JHUISI/charm#readme)

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the remaining requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

From the root of the repo, run the authority server listening for local-only connections:

```bash
python -m uvicorn vista.server:app
```

Run the client to request a 10 minute authorization from the authority and start a transceiver

```bash
python -m vista.client run --duration 10
```

Client options can be viewed from the CLI help menu

```bash
python -m vista.client [authorize|loadset|run] --help
```

Authority and server parameters can be set in environment variables or a `vista.env` file

An entire ecosystem, including the authority server and multiple clients can be instantiated and run using Docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose up --scale client=10
```
